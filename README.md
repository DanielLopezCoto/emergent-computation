# emergent-computation

This code here provided is my degree project.

Codes:

emergent.py -> is the main code.
test_regla.py -> is the code that test the better rule.
filtro.py -> is a filter for the Cellular Automaton to see the interacting particles.

The code: triangulo_CA.py is not mine. This code belongs to Carlos Mestre Gonzalez, but is usefull
if you want take a previous look how works the codification of the rules.
